# Controlled-robot-car-by-Bluetooth
## Overview
* We will create a Bluetooth Controlled Robot Car with Arduino. A Smartphone may be used to operate the robotic automobile wirelessly. The smartphone has an Android software that allows the user to transmit orders straight to Robot. The robot has the ability to move forward, backward, left, and right, as well as halt.
* The Arduino Bluetooth-controlled robot vehicle is linked to an HC-06 Bluetooth module. We may give the robot precise voice instructions using an Android app loaded on the phone. A Bluetooth transmitter module receives the orders and passes them to the Arduino, allowing the robotic automobile to be commanded.
